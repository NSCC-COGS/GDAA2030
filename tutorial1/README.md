# Tutorial 1 (the github expansion pack!)

Lets do our first thing together on github! 
Previously we had completed Tutorial 1 in class. Good work! Now we are all going to move that code to github so it is <i>officially</i> recorded for the world to see in glorious OpenSource! 

Above this readme you should find a folder with your super special gitHub login name.
