# Tutorial 3

Tutorial 3  as partially completed in class right before the march break and ensuing quarantine. Some of you may have completed this task but assigning it for grading is tricky as we all lost access to the classroom - and perhaps some software. As such - you may want to upload what you completed for tutorial 3 to the [Course Brightspace](https://nscconline.desire2learn.com/d2l/lms/dropbox/admin/folders_manage.d2l?ou=142612) for bonus marks. (The total amount of bonus marks avilable is enough to replace tutorial 4 or 5 if you so desire)
