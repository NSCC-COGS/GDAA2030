# Tutorial 4 (formally known as 3)

## Some Backgorund 

Were really cooking now! We're finally venturing beyond where we went together in class. In this tutorial I hope to show some of the nifty features readily avilable to you in python (and Google Colab) when you import some pretty great and light weight libraries. 

Here were going to look at:
* scikit-image 
* pyproj 
* folium 
* scikit lean 


### But - lets build on what weve done!

Lets use our little script from tutorial 2 to grab a landsat image to play with!

Were going to avoid the relatively short list of steps for [setting up a python package](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) in our little git repo just to keep things simple for us. If we did this we could do fancy things like <code>%pip install git+https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030.git</code> and <code>import GDAA2030</code>>and things..., but I digress! We're instead going to continue using our little <i>hacky</i> method of importing functions from our repo. 

## Instructions
<span style="color:orange;">NOTE THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS</span>

Detailed wordy instructions will be inbound shortly - I figured id give you guys a heads up as to whats coming. You can head over to [/tutorial4/kevinkmcguigan](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/tree/master/tutorial4/kevinkmcguigan) to have a look at the example <code>.ipynb</code> we'll be working on. 

Basically we will be: 
* following along with an example .ipynb 
* building on the functions written in tutorial 2
* demonstrating som basic image processing (Using libraries like [scipy-ndimage](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html), [skimage](https://scikit-image.org/))
* building a landsat composite image
* displaying numpy images on a webmap (using [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/))

* Finally - the 'assignment at the end will be to choose an additional filter or function from [scipy-ndimage](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html) or [skimage](https://scikit-image.org/) and apply it to our landsat composite. 

If this proves to be a bit much (i could understand that) we can tailor it back some. Ill be here to help. So have a quick peek at [/tutorial4/kevinkmcguigan](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/tree/master/tutorial4/kevinkmcguigan) and stay safe! cheers

(more to some soon)
