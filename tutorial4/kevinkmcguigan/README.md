# Tutorial 4

Hey folks - for this tutorial we will be messing around with some of the key principals for suing numpy arrays as images. We'll also be used a few of the major libraries to help us out. Check out the attached .ipynb I've created as a guide for what we're going to be doing. 

The Assignment of this tutorial is to recreate what i have done in the attached .ipynb and then add ONE more function from [skimage](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/api.html), [ndimage](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.1/reference/tutorial/ndimage.html) or another image processing library using what we learned about converting from 16, 32, 8, and 1 bit images..
