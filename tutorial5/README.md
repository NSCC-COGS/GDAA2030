# Tutorial 5

For tutorial 5 are exploring the Gradient Boost Decision Tree and making it work for geographic data, specifically RGB and elevation data, to compute both regression and classificaiton models using control data such as labeled data. For this tutorial - you will once again develop a .ipynb based on the content of the example [GDAA2030_T5_kevinmc.ipynb](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/blob/master/tutorial5/kevinkmcguigan/GDAA2030_T5_kevinmc.ipynb) contained in the [example directory](https://github.com/NSCC-COGS/GDAA2030/tree/master/tutorial5/kevinkmcguigan). For this tutorial there are not - gotchas and 'now you trys' - simply work your way though the tutorial as best you can and submit the results. Most importantly - I want to encourage you all to dig deeper into some of the machine learning tools available (and referenced in the .ipynb) and never be afraid to try something out! Experimentation *is* how we all learn - thats the scientific method.  

Good luck and reach out if you have any quesions or concerns. 

*Note I have found a couple mistakes and typos mostly in the figure titles that may cause come confusion - I'll get a fax as soon as I can*
