# Working together

Hey class! Github is <i>the</i> place for collaborative programming work online. Well.. its a place. a good place!
I encourage you to play around and get familiar with the interface. One of the beauties to git, a form of 'source control', 
is that it is actually kind of safe to play around with! If things go awry you can typically 'roll-back' the entire repository! 

In class we each got setup with a gitHub account. We also experimented with [GitHub for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). But! You should be able to get access to some of the more key features of git directly from the website including:  
- viewing the hosted code
- downloading the codebase
- uploading code

learning git can be a bit confusing. So many strange terms.. Honestly a good place to start (apart from familiarizing yourself with the interface) maybe to take a look at the [glossary of git terms](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary).

<b> Please Note: This is a <i>public</i> repository meaning that anything you post here will be aviliable for the wolrd to see. But don't be shy!</b>

## More Information

This is called the 'readme.' Itâ€™s a bit of a central landing page explaining the repository. You can find out some more information about how to setup a readme [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)



## Stay tuned!

Once I see a few people jumped onto the git - expect to see some new materials coming on. 
For one, I would like to move our old tutorials up here so we can share them and maybe even begin to make some improvements.
